Farewell 2020 and Happy New Year 2021

<!--more-->

It is a difficulty year for almost everyone. The way we live and work has been completely changed. It is very likely that this new life-style, the post-covid era, will continue even when it all ends. However, this pandemic is also a valuable experience for everyone of us. It is only under such huge challenge that we discover the true meaning of life. We found that the most precious gift is our beloved ones. We found that we can develop new technologies to fight the great enemy of mankind. We found that if you try this new life, you may get new inspirations and new progresses.

Whatever, now we can say *Farewell 2020 and Happy New Year 2021*. I hope all my friends will bring good luck to their lives.
