abstract: The robotic replacement of disc cutters in tunnel boring machine (TBM) is imperative for maintenance tasks' safety and efficiency. One major challenge is to managing the complex and cumbersome fastening components of disc cutters. This paper introduces a multifunctional end-effector that can grip a combined wrench to facilitate the alignment, fastening, and unfastening of cutter bolts, as well as grip the disc cutter. An integrated cutter house design eliminates the need for the robot to handle small bolts and nuts during remote operations. Additionally, a two-segment bolt design aids in the peg-in-hole procedure, ensuring a high success rate for robotic torque wrench alignment with the main fastening bolt. An alignment strategy for remote robot control is also proposed. We constructed a full-scale mock-up of the TBM disc cutter with the proposed cutter house structure to validate the proposed design and methods. Preliminary experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the system's mechanism and strategy in facilitating the swift assembly and disassembly of heavy disc cutters during replacement processes.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We developed a multifunctional end-effector for robotic replacement of disc cutters in TBM. Especially, the two-segment bolt structure, combined wrench structure, and peg-in-hole strategy are proposed in this paper. The two-segment bolt structure effectively separates the pitch and roll angular deviations for efficient alignment. The combined wrench uses high torque for fastening/unfastening and low torque for rapid drive, while the peg-in-hole strategy provides a simple, reliable and efficient method for successful disc cutter replacement operations.
With the proposed method, the wrench can align with the bolts efficiently, and the fastening component can be released rapidly. This enables the multifunctional end-effector to proceed with disc cutter replacement. Experimental alignment data at offset and standard positions validate the effectiveness of the cutter housing and the two-segment bolt and sock design in facilitating the swift assembly and disassembly of heavy disc cutters during replacement processes. However, if the reaction arm does not contact the end-effector, the robot experiences a substantial torque load. In future work, we plan to develop more detailed strategies to mitigate this issue.
