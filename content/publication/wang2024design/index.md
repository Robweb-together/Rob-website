abstract: With the expanding of pipeline applications and development in related technologies, there is a growing requirement for inside anti-corrosion of pipelines. Currently, there is relatively limited application of robots for large-diameter pipeline inside anti-corrosion, and the design of such robots often facing coupling issues between the locomotion capability and operation requirements. In this study, an axiomatic design method is employed to analyze the design of a pipeline inside anti-corrosion robot, and a decoupling method is proposed to separate the locomotion and the anti-corrosion mechanism. The robot design is implemented with the axiomatic method. Preliminary analysis using dynamic simulation demonstrates that the robot equipped with independently adjustable steering functions works more stably and effectively during anti-corrosion operations pipelines inside.
# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This paper proposes a decoupling solution for the design of an in-pipe maintenance robot using AD method. The robot locomotion function and maintenance function are analyzed and a decoupling design method is proposed. The introduction of a steering mechanism effectively addresses the couple issue when the robot performs rotational paint spraying for corrosion prevention within pipelines. The design of the robot is validated through dynamic simulations. The research results demonstrate the successful implementation of decoupling design, resulting in smoother motion trajectories. At the same time, the force of the wheels is also more stable, and the running state of the robot is more stable. Future studies will focus on resolving force fluctuations in each wheel of the pipelines.
